# Group presentations

Please push your presentations to this repo as separate sub-directories, indicating the order that you presented, your name (one group member only), and a v. brief description, all separated by dashes. E.g.: `01-FirstnameLastname-Topic/`.

## R Markdown

Please try to make your presentations using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). You can use any one of the multiple slide deck options. (For what it's worth, I use the [xaringan package with a modified metropolis theme](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Themes) for my lecture slides). Or you can output as a [GitHub document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html) or [HTML document](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html). If you choose the latter, I would request that you please include `keep_md: true` in your YAML, so that it is readable directly on GitHub.

## Topics

Topics will be randomly allocated to groups of 2 students. Both of you should contribute to both the presentation and the practice session, but you can divide main responsibilities.
